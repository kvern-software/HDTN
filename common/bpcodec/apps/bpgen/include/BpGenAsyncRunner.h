 *
 * This BpGenAsyncRunner class is used for launching the BpGenAsync class into its own process.
 * The BpGenAsyncRunner provides a blocking Run function which creates and
 * initializes a BpGenAsync object by processing/using the various command line arguments.
 * BpGenAsyncRunner also provides a signal handler listener to capture Ctrl+C (SIGINT) events
 * for clean termination.
