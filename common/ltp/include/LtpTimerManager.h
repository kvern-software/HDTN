 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This LtpTimerManager templated class encapsulates a shared boost::asio::deadline_timer
 * for use with all LTP sessions within a single-threaded LTP sender "exclusive or" receiver engine.
 * The class uses/shares the user's provided boost::asio::deadline_timer
 * and hence uses/shares the user's provided boost::asio::io_service.
 * This is a single threaded class designed to run and be called from one ioService thread only.
 * Time expiration is based on 2*(one_way_light_time + one_way_margin_time)
 * Explicit template instantiation is defined in its .cpp file for idType of Ltp::session_id_t and uint64_t.
 * The idType is a "serial number" used to associate an expiry time with.
