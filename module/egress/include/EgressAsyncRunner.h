 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This EgressAsyncRunner class is used for launching just the HDTN Egress module into its own process.
 * The EgressAsyncRunner provides a blocking Run function which creates and
 * initializes an Egress object by processing/using the various command line arguments.
 * EgressAsyncRunner is only used when running HDTN in distributed mode in which there
 * is a single process dedicated to Egress.
 * EgressAsyncRunner also provides a signal handler listener to capture Ctrl+C (SIGINT) events
 * for clean termination.
